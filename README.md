## Project Description
This is a web application that aims to widen the customer base of my fictitious deli pizza place where my customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings.    
I am tasked to implement everything I have learnt from Bootstrap, jQuery and JavaScript.    
Some of the requirements that the project is supposed to meet include:    
- Determine the prices for each pizza size.
- Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
- Determine the cost for the crust.
- The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
- On checkout, the application displays the orders’ summary together with the total amount charged.
